- Stages 4-12 can have some parallel development, but each domain integration depends on Stage 4 (Authentication)
- Stage 13 runs partially in parallel with Stages 4-12, with final focus after all features are implemented

## Success Criteria

- Application runs on both web and Android platforms
- All features work in offline mode with local data
- Online features gracefully degrade when offline
- UI is responsive and accessible
- Performance meets or exceeds benchmarks
- All critical paths have test coverage
